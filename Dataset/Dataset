Hi-C Temporal Forecasting Dataset

Description:
This dataset contains sequential Hi-C contact matrices used for training and evaluating
CNN-based Hi-C forecasting models with temporal attention mechanisms. The data is
organized to support next-step prediction from historical Hi-C matrices.

Data Format:
- Each sample consists of a sequence of historical Hi-C matrices and a corresponding
  target future matrix.
- Input shape: [T, H, W], where T denotes the number of historical time steps.
- Target shape: [H, W].
- All matrices are normalized to the range [0, 1].

Temporal Setup:
- Historical window size (T): 2
- Prediction target: next time-step Hi-C matrix

Train/Test Split:
- Training set: 80%
- Test set: 20%
- The split is performed sequentially to preserve temporal order.

Resolution:
- Hi-C matrix resolution is consistent across all samples.
- The same resolution is used for all experiments to ensure fair comparison.

Usage:
This dataset was used consistently across all experiments, including:
- Baseline CNN model
- Single-head temporal attention model
- Multi-head temporal attention model

The dataset is provided for reproducibility and evaluation purposes.
View-only access is enabled to preserve data integrity.
